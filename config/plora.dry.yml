# DRY RUN CONFIG

# base_model: Hugging Face model id for training and evaluation.
# Meaning: Backbone LM used across training, value-add, and metrics.
# Options: any causal LM (e.g., google/gemma-3-1b-it for CPU; google/gemma-3-1b-it for better quality).
# Rationale: Pick a small/efficient model for speed in dry runs.
base_model: google/gemma-3-1b-it

# eval_split: Dataset split for evaluation.
# Meaning: Which split value-add and metrics read (not training split).
# Options: validation, test, or dataset-specific names.
# Rationale: "validation" is widely available and avoids test leakage.
eval_split: validation

# samples: Per-domain training sample cap.
# Meaning: Upper bound on training pairs; controls runtime vs. adapter stability.
# Options: integer ≥ 1; larger → slower but more stable; smaller → faster but noisier.
# Rationale: 32 keeps end-to-end runs fast.
samples: 32

# latency_budget_ms: Guardrail for latency checks (ms).
# Meaning: Upper bound on acceptable median latency (e.g., LoRA inject/remove) before failing.
# Options: 250–500 (strict CI/GPU), ~1000 (GPU), ~5000 (CPU laptop).
# Rationale: 5000 tolerates CPU variability in smoke tests.
latency_budget_ms: 5000

# domains: Labels for per-domain adapters.
# Meaning: Defines domains for training/value-add/swarms.
# Options: any consistent labels supported by dataset loaders.
# Rationale: Core trio aligned with repository fixtures.
domains: [arithmetic, legal, medical]

# allowed_ranks: Whitelisted LoRA ranks in Security Gate.
# Meaning: Only adapters with these ranks will pass policy.
# Options: list of positive integers (e.g., [1,4,8,16]).
# Rationale: Smaller ranks favored for speed in dry runs.
allowed_ranks: [1]

# allowed_targets: Target-module whitelist for Security Gate.
# Meaning: Restricts LoRA target modules (suffix-based); "attention" maps to ATTENTION_SUFFIXES.
# Options: attention | all | explicit list of suffixes.
# Rationale: "attention" is a safe, repo-aligned baseline.
allowed_targets: attention

# graph: Overlay parameters for Swarm v2 diffusion.
# Meaning: Controls topology/connectivity → spectral gap λ2 → diffusion speed.
# Options: see fields; tune by topology and size.
# Rationale: Balanced defaults for quick runs.
graph:
  # p: ER edge probability; higher → denser → larger λ2 → faster diffusion.
  # Options: ~0.15–0.4 for N∈[20,160].
  # Rationale: 0.3 for faster dry diffusion.
  p: 0.3
  # ws_k: WS degree parameter (even), neighbors per side.
  # Options: 2–8 (even) for small N.
  # Rationale: 4 offers small-world connectivity without high degree.
  ws_k: 4
  # ws_beta: WS rewiring probability; 0 → lattice, 1 → random.
  # Options: 0.1–0.4 typical.
  # Rationale: 0.2 yields balanced small-world behavior.
  ws_beta: 0.2
  # ba_m: BA edges per arriving node.
  # Options: 1–4 typical.
  # Rationale: 2 keeps average degree modest while forming hubs.
  ba_m: 2

# value_add: Evaluation grid defaults.
# Meaning: Controls evaluation set size and adapter grid.
# Options: see fields below.
# Rationale: Compact grid for smoke significance.
value_add:
  # dev_size: Number of eval pairs per domain. Larger → tighter CIs, more time.
  # Options: 256–1024+ depending on resources.
  # Rationale: 256 balances CI precision and speed.
  dev_size: 256
  # ranks: LoRA ranks to evaluate.
  # Options: list of integers; include higher ranks to test capacity effects.
  # Rationale: Minimal set to demonstrate scaling.
  ranks: [2, 4]
  # schemes: Target-module schemes.
  # Options: attention | mlp | all.
  # Rationale: "all" evaluates broader targeting.
  schemes: [all]
  # seeds: RNG seeds for repeatability; more seeds → more robust stats.
  # Options: list of integers; e.g., [41,42,43].
  # Rationale: Single seed suffices for smoke runs.
  seeds: [41]
